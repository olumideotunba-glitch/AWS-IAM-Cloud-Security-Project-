# AWS-IAM-Cloud-Security-Project-
I completed this project on cloud security controls in Amazon Web Services (AWS), focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM). The goal was to create a least‑privilege policy, attach it to a user group, and verify that the policy correctly restricts actions on two Amazon EC2 instances (marketing and sales).
